# Functionality
The application is based on the Asian board game Go, which is characterized by its simple rules but enormous strategic complexity. In their moves, the players place alternately black and white stones on the intersections of the lines. The goal is to cover as much to "dominate" as much territory on the board as possible, by creating enclosed territories and surrounding stones. If a player manages to completely surround a group of stones of the opponent completely, these stones are captured and removed from the board.
